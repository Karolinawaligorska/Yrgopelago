# Island name

My island is called "Porcelain Paradise" and is teacup-themed.

# Hotel name

My hotel is called Tea-rrific Hotel since it's terrific and tea-themed.
My hotel has one star and none counting, this is because i had some trubles with the cURL method i used for the APIs, which resulted in a lack of time to aim for a higher rating. The fact that my hotel is one-starred doesn't bother me much, i hope to get a lot of guests with my low prices!
