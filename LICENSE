I am sorry to announce that I am not sure what to write about here.

My code is structured into three seperate files, an index.php, that after all doesn't contain any php, and then two php files called "bookings.php" and "avaliability.php. I have also gotten fund of using separete css files, to easily keep track of my code.

I am aware that i do not have 20 pushes to my Github repo. This is partly because I forgot about it so very sorry about that, and partly because I sometimes got so stuck that it was better to not push and start over from were I was before than to try to clean up the code that got me so confused in the first place.

Cheers!
